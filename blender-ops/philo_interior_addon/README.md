# Philo Interior Generator

A professional Blender addon for creating photorealistic interior visualizations with automated room generation, lighting presets, and intelligent furniture placement.

## Features

### üè† Room Generation
- **Customizable room size**: 4-50 meters with 6-meter tall ceilings
- **Material presets**:
  - Floors: Wood, Marble, Concrete, Carpet
  - Walls: Paint, Wallpaper, Brick, Plaster

### üì¶ Smart Model Import
- **Single model import**: Import GLB, GLTF, FBX, or OBJ files
- **Batch folder import**: Process entire furniture libraries at once
- **Intelligent placement**:
  - Automatic floor positioning
  - Linear X-axis arrangement for folder imports (no overlapping)
  - Optional collision detection with adjustable spacing
  - Dynamic room size recommendations based on imported models

### üì∏ Camera & Rendering
- **Optimized camera setup**: Fixed at 3.5m height with distance scaling
- **Quality presets**:
  - Preview: 64 samples (75% resolution for quick tests)
  - Medium: 256 samples (full resolution)
  - High: 2048 samples (production quality)
- OpenImageDenoise for all quality levels
- Adaptive sampling for optimal performance

### üîß Additional Tools
- **Model scaling**: Resize selected models (0.1x to 5x) with automatic floor repositioning
- **Physics collision**: Add rigid body physics to objects for simulations

## Installation

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Room Size**: Generate room AFTER importing to get size recommendations
2. **Lighting**: Each preset is optimized for specific use cases
3. **Performance**: Enable GPU compute in Blender preferences
4. **Quality**: Start with Preview, use High for final renders

## Troubleshooting

**Import errors**: Check file paths and verify 3D file validity
**Models overlapping**: Ensure adequate room size for all models
**Slow rendering**: Reduce quality or enable GPU compute
**Dark renders**: Apply lighting preset after room generation

## Version History

- **v1.0.0**: Complete interior visualization workflow
  - Room generation with materials
  - Three lighting presets
  - Smart furniture import
  - Camera optimization
  - High-quality rendering

## Code Architecture

The addon follows Blender's best practices with clear separation:
- **operators.py**: Contains 8 main operators and helper functions
- **props.py**: Defines 9 scene properties for settings storage  
- **ui.py**: Creates 6 UI panels organized by workflow
- **__init__.py**: Handles registration and addon metadata
