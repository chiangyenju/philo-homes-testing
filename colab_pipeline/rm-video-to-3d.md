        "floor_boundary": polygon_coordinates,
        "wall_positions": wall_data_with_normals
    },
    "openings": [
        {"type": "door", "position": [x,y,z], "dimensions": [0.8, 2.0]},
        {"type": "window", "position": [x,y,z], "dimensions": [1.2, 1.0]}
    ],
    "furniture_constraints": {
        "walkable_areas": safe_movement_zones,

## üì± **Simple Usage**

### **Step 1: Record Video**
```
üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Walk around room perimeter (30-60 seconds)
üì± Use phone camera at eye level
üé• Overlap viewpoints, include all corners
üìπ Upload to Colab as 'room_video.mp4'
```

### **Step 2: Run Pipeline**
```python
# One-line execution
room_data = process_room_video_simple('/content/room_video.mp4')
```

### **Step 3: Get Results**
```python
# Immediate access to all data
dimensions = room_data['room_geometry']['dimensions']
doors = [o for o in room_data['openings'] if o['type'] == 'door']
furniture_zones = room_data['furniture_constraints']['wall_adjacent_zones']
```
